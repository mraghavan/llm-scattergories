A high-contrast, stylized, close-up image of a green owl's face, primarily in a square format with rounded corners. The owl has a bright, vibrant lime green body and face with slightly darker emerald green details suggesting feathers, particularly around the large, forward-facing eyes and brow. The two eyes are large, oval, and mostly white, with dark gray or black pupils that give the owl a slightly stern or focused expression. The beak is small, triangular, and colored a contrasting bright orange-yellow. The overall style is flat, modern, and simple, using block colors without shading or complex textures.
